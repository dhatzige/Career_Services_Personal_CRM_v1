# Agile Improvement Plan - Career Services CRM
**Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks per sprint

## üîç Current State Analysis

### What's Already Implemented
1. **Consultation Status** ‚úÖ
   - Field exists in types: `status?: 'scheduled' | 'attended' | 'no-show' | 'cancelled' | 'rescheduled'`
   - UI partially implemented in StudentDetailModal
   - Auto-status for future consultations (always 'scheduled')

2. **Meeting Management**
   - Basic calendar page with upcoming meetings
   - Calendly integration for scheduling
   - Location tracking (in-person/online/phone)

3. **Database Architecture** ‚úÖ
   - Hybrid approach working (SQLite + Supabase Auth)
   - No more constraint errors
   - Flexible schema changes possible

### Issues Found

#### 1. Code Duplication üö®
**Multiple Delete Implementations** (9 files!):
- `clientSideDelete.ts`
- `simpleDelete.ts`
- `supabaseDeleteWorkaround.ts`
- `flexibleDelete.ts`
- `testDeletePermissions.ts`
- Multiple delete-related utilities

**Root Cause**: Previous attempts to work around Supabase RLS policies created technical debt.

#### 2. Overly Complex Architecture
- Database adapter has incomplete SQLite query builder
- Multiple API layers (frontend utils + backend routes)
- Consultation management split across multiple files

#### 3. Missing Features (from WORKFLOW_IMPROVEMENTS.md)
- No "Today's View" for daily workflow
- No quick action buttons for attendance
- No bulk operations
- No cancellation tracking UI
- No meeting link storage/display

## üöß Technical Debt to Address

### Immediate

2. Consolidate API endpoints
3. Clean up test files

### Future
1. Implement proper caching strategy
2. Add comprehensive error boundaries
3. Create integration tests

## üìù Notes

### Why This Approach?
1. **Clean First**: Remove complexity before adding features
2. **User-Focused**: Prioritize daily workflow improvements
3. **Incremental**: Small, measurable improvements
4. **Sustainable**: Reduce technical debt while building

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Keep backup of working code, test thoroughly
  
- **Risk**: Scope creep
  - **Mitigation**: Strict sprint boundaries, clear DoD

- **Risk**: User disruption
  - **Mitigation**: Deploy during off-hours, feature flags

## üîÑ Next Steps
1. Start with TASK-001 immediately
2. Daily standup notes in this file
3. Update task status as completed
4. Sprint retrospective after each sprint
