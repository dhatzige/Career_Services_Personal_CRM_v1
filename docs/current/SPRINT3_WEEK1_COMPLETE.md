## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### 1. Database Enhancement
- Added `no_show_count` and `last_no_show_date` fields to students table
- Created migration script `add_noshow_tracking.sql`
- Updated all relevant models and types

### 2. Automatic Tracking

  - Total Attended (green)
  - No-Shows (red) with last date
  - Attendance Rate (blue) as percentage
- High no-show warning when count >= 3
- Actionable message suggesting outreach

#### Dashboard
- New stat card showing total no-shows across all students

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Sprint 3 Week 2 Tasks:
1. **TASK-011**: Consultation Reports
   - Daily summary emails
   - Weekly metrics dashboard
   - Export functionality

2. **TASK-012**: Performance Optimization
   - Lazy loading implementation
   - Caching strategy
   - Query optimization

3. **TASK-013**: UI/UX Polish
   - Consistent status colors
   - Mobile experience improvements
   - Keyboard shortcuts

## üìù Notes

### Development Insights
1. Toast notification pattern was inconsistent - now standardized
2. No-show tracking provides valuable student engagement data
3. Visual indicators crucial for quick pattern recognition
4. Automatic counting prevents human error

### Security Considerations
- No-show data properly sanitized
- Counter updates use transactions
- Access controls maintained

### Best Practices Applied
