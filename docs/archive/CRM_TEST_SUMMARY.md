- Displays "No students yet" message when empty
- Has "Add Your First Student" button

### 3. Navigation
- Sidebar navigation is visible and functional
- Can navigate to:
  - ✅ Students page
  - ✅ Calendar page (loads but missing h1 title)
  - ✅ Career Services page
  - ✅ Settings page
  - ✅ Back to Dashboard

## ⚠️ Issues Found

### 1. Page Titles
- Calendar page is missing an h1 with "Calendar" text
- Some pages have multiple h1 elements causing selector conflicts

### 2. User Menu
- User avatar button (with "A") is clickable
- But email address doesn't appear in the dropdown menu

### 3. Playwright Specific Issues

- Some elements appear visible but Playwright can't interact with them

## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### Original Problem
- After login, users were redirected to `/dashboard` which didn't exist
- Fixed by changing redirects to `/` (root path where Dashboard component is mounted)

### Environment Variables
- `.env.local` was overriding `.env` with incorrect Supabase URLs
- Fixed by updating `.env.local` with correct credentials
