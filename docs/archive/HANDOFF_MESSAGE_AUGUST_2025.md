**Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Version**: 0.7.0  
**Last Session Summary**: Implemented TASK-011 Consultation Reports

---

## 📋 Quick Start for Next Session

Hi! You're working on a **Career Services CRM** for a university. It's a web app that helps career counselors track student consultations, manage career development, and analyze engagement patterns.

### 🎯 What to say when starting:
```
"I'm continuing work on the Career Services CRM v0.7.0. I just completed the consultation reports feature (TASK-011). The system uses SQLite for data and Supabase for auth only. Backend runs on port 4001, frontend on 5173. Next tasks are TASK-012 (Performance Optimization) and TASK-013 (UI/UX Polish) from Sprint 3 Week 2."
```

## 🏗️ System Overview

### Architecture
```
Frontend (React) → Backend API (Express) → SQLite + Supabase Auth
   Port 5173           Port 4001            Local DB   Cloud Auth
```

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, React Router v6
- **Backend**: Express, TypeScript, SQLite3, date-fns
- **Auth**: Supabase (authentication only, NOT for data)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking
- **Email**: Resend API (configured but needs API key)

## 📁 Critical Files to Know

### Documentation
1. **CLAUDE.md** - AI-specific context (check this first!)
2. **/docs/current/AGILE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md** - Sprint tasks and progress
3. **/docs/current/SPRINT3_WEEK2_STATUS.md** - Current sprint status
4. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history (currently at v0.7.0)

### Recent Work (August 1, 2025)
1. **Report Controller**: `/backend/src/controllers/reportController.ts`
2. **Reports Page**: `/src/pages/ReportsPage.tsx`
3. **API Routes**: `/backend/src/routes/reports.ts`
4. **Database Migration**: `/backend/src/database/migrations/add_report_columns.sql`

## ✅ What Was Just Completed

### TASK-011: Consultation Reports
- ✅ Daily summary reports (attendance, no-shows, by advisor)
- ✅ Weekly metrics dashboard (7-day overview, patterns)
- ✅ Email functionality (HTML templates, one-click send)
- ✅ CSV export (consultations, students, weekly metrics)
- ✅ Added "Reports" to navigation menu
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors in models
- ✅ Updated Sentry syntax (transactions → spans)

### Previous Features Working
- Student management with tags
- Consultation tracking with status
- Today's view with quick actions
- No-show tracking (automatic counters)
- Notes system (multiple types)
- Calendar integration (Calendly)

## ⚠️ Important Context

### Database Setup
- **SQLite** stores all application data at `/backend/data/students.db`
- **Supabase** is used ONLY for authentication
- This hybrid approach was adopted to avoid Supabase RLS constraint errors

### Common Issues
1. **Port 5173 busy**: Frontend will use 5174 automatically
2. **TypeScript errors**: Some exist in example files (non-critical)
3. **Email not sending**: Need to set RESEND_API_KEY in backend/.env
4. **Build warnings**: Deprecated Sentry methods in some files

### Sentry Access
- Organization: `act-l6`
- Region: `https://de.sentry.io`
- Projects: `career-services-frontend`, `career-services-backend`
- All recent issues are resolved

## 🚀 Next Tasks (Sprint 3 Week 2)

### TASK-012: Performance Optimization
- Implement React.lazy for code splitting
- Add caching layer (Redis or in-memory)
- Optimize database queries
- Add indexes for common queries
- Implement pagination for large lists

### TASK-013: UI/UX Polish
- Standardize status colors across app
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Enhance loading states
- Consistent button styles

## 💻 Development Commands

```bash
# Start everything
npm run dev

# Backend only (port 4001)
cd backend && npm run dev

# Frontend only (port 5173)
npm run dev:frontend

# Run tests
npm test

# Check types
npm run typecheck

# Apply migrations
cd backend && sqlite3 data/students.db < src/database/migrations/[file].sql
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in `/backend/.env`:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-key
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your-key (for email reports)
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@example.com
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
SENTRY_DSN=your-dsn
```

## 📊 Current Feature Set

1. **Students**: Full CRUD with programs, tags, career interests
2. **Consultations**: Scheduling, attendance, cancellations
3. **Today's View**: Quick actions, bulk operations, auto no-show
4. **Reports**: Daily summaries, weekly metrics, email, CSV export
5. **No-Show Tracking**: Automatic counting, alerts at 3+
6. **Notes**: Multiple types, private option, search
7. **Dashboard**: Stats, charts, alerts for high no-shows

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always use TodoWrite** to track your progress
2. **Check Sentry** (mcp_sentry tools) for errors
3. **Run typecheck** before major changes
4. **Follow existing patterns** - the codebase is consistent
5. **Test in dev** before implementing complex features

## 📝 Final Notes

The system is stable and feature-complete for core functionality. The codebase is well-organized with clear separation of concerns. Focus is now on performance optimization and polish rather than new features.

When you start, check:
1. CLAUDE.md for AI-specific instructions
2. Current sprint status in /docs/current/
3. Run `npm run dev` to ensure everything starts
4. Check Sentry for any new issues

Good luck! The project is in great shape at v0.7.0. 🚀
