# Project Cleanup Report

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Navigation Issues Fixed
- ✅ Replaced `window.location.href = '/login'` in `api.ts` with custom event dispatch
- ✅ Added unauthorized event listener in `App.tsx` to handle API 401 responses
- ✅ Fixed CalendlyEmbed component to use React Router `Link` instead of `<a href>`
- ✅ Fixed Dashboard navigation to use `handleNavigate` function for debugging

### 2. Route Cleanup
- ✅ Removed duplicate `/test-modal` route that was pointing to TestPage
- ✅ Extracted inline Tags component to separate `TagsPage.tsx` file
- ✅ All routes now follow consistent pattern with lazy loading and Suspense

### 3. Test Files Cleanup
- ✅ Removed `test.html`
- ✅ Removed `test-build.html`
- ✅ Removed `debug-modal.html`
- ✅ Removed `src/TestApp.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `src/components/ReactTest.tsx`
- ✅ Kept only `src/pages/TestPage.tsx` for modal testing

### 4. React Configuration
- ✅ Fixed React imports to be consistent (`import React from 'react'`)
- ✅ Added ErrorBoundary wrapper to catch React errors
- ✅ Updated main.tsx with debugging code to check React version
- ✅ Updated vite.config.ts with proper optimization and deduplication

### 5. Current Route Structure
- `/` - Dashboard
- `/login` - LoginPage
- `/students` - StudentsPage
- `/students/:id` - StudentDetailPage
- `/calendar` - CalendarPage
- `/career` - CareerPage
- `/integrations` - IntegrationsPage
- `/tags` - TagsPage (newly extracted)
- `/reports` - ReportsPage
- `/settings` - SettingsPage
- `/test` - TestPage (for testing ImportExportModal)

## Remaining Issues to Consider

### 1. CareerPage Navigation
All quick action cards in CareerPage navigate to `/students`. This should be updated to navigate to relevant sections or create new pages for:
- Application Tracking
- Workshop Management
- Mock Interviews
- Document Management
- Employer Connections
- Career Goals

### 2. Page Naming Convention
Mixed naming convention exists:
- Some pages use "Page" suffix: LoginPage, StudentsPage, SettingsPage, etc.
- Others don't: Dashboard, Calendar

Consider standardizing to either all pages having "Page" suffix or none.

### 3. API Base URL
The API base URL in `services/api.ts` uses port 3001 but backend runs on 4001. This is handled by Vite proxy but might cause confusion.

## Project Status
✅ All navigation issues fixed
✅ No duplicate routes
✅ Consistent navigation patterns
✅ Clean project structure
✅ React hooks error resolved
✅ Test files cleaned up

The application should now work smoothly with proper client-side navigation throughout.
