# Career Services CRM - E2E Test Report

**Date**: July 30, 2025  
**Test Environment**: Local Development  
**Tester**: Automated Playwright Tests

## Executive Summary

The Career Services CRM application has been tested for core functionality. The application is running successfully with React modules loading correctly after fixing the AuthProvider context issue. However, several areas require attention before production deployment.

## Test Results Overview

### ✅ Passed Tests

1. **Application Loading**
   - Frontend loads successfully at http://localhost:5173
   - React modules load without errors
   - Login page displays all required elements
   - Social login buttons (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn) are visible

2. **Backend Connectivity**
   - Backend API responds at http://localhost:4001
   - Health endpoint is accessible (though rate-limited)
   - Error handling works correctly

3. **Security Features**
   - Rate limiting is actively working (429 responses after multiple requests)
   - Invite-only system is enforced (public signup disabled)
   - CORS and security headers are properly configured

### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Authentication System**
   - Master account (dhatzige@act.edu) not found in database
   - Supabase authentication not fully configured
   - Legacy authentication fallback not working due to rate limiting
   - Need to create initial accounts through Supabase dashboard

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Multiple AuthProvider contexts causing confusion
   - Supabase environment variables need verification
   - Rate limiting too aggressive for testing (blocks after ~5 requests)

3. **Testing Limitations**
   - Cannot test authenticated features without valid accounts
   - Rate limiting prevents comprehensive API testing
   - Supabase MCP requires access token for management operations

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Infrastructure Tests

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Frontend Server | ✅ Pass | Vite dev server running on port 5173 |
| Backend Server | ✅ Pass | Express server running on port 4001 |
| Database Connection | ⚠️ Unknown | SQLite working, Supabase connection unclear |
| React Module Loading | ✅ Pass | Fixed after correcting AuthProvider import |

### 2. Authentication Tests

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Login Page Display | ✅ Pass | All form elements visible |
| Social Login Buttons | ✅ Pass | Google, GitHub, LinkedIn buttons present |
| Master Account Login | ❌ Fail | Account not found in database |
| Public Signup | ✅ Pass | Correctly disabled (invite-only) |
| Password Reset | ⚠️ Not Tested | Requires valid account |

### 3. Security Tests

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Rate Limiting | ✅ Pass | Working (429 after ~5 requests) |
| Unauthorized Access | ✅ Pass | Redirects to login page |
| Security Headers | ✅ Pass | CSP, CORS, and other headers present |
| API Protection | ✅ Pass | Endpoints protected |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Create Master Account**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use Supabase Dashboard
   # Navigate to Authentication > Users and create account
   
   # Option 2: Temporarily disable signup restrictions
   # Create account, then re-enable restrictions
   ```

2. **Adjust Rate Limiting for Development**
   ```javascript
   // In backend/.env
   RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000  // Increase for testing
   RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
   ```

3. **Fix Authentication Flow**
   - Verify Supabase URL and keys in .env files
   - Ensure backend uses correct env variable names
   - Test social login providers configuration

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Complete Testing**
   - Student management CRUD operations
   - Consultation scheduling
   - Career services features
   - File uploads
   - Email notifications
   - Reporting and exports

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Enable Supabase RLS policies
   - Configure proper rate limits
   - Set up monitoring with Sentry
   - Enable audit logging

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing with multiple concurrent users
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching layer verification

## Test Suite Files Created

1. `playwright/tests/e2e-comprehensive.spec.ts` - Full test suite
2. `playwright/tests/quick-smoke-test.spec.ts` - Basic health checks
3. `playwright/tests/auth-test.spec.ts` - Authentication testing
4. `playwright/tests/create-account.spec.ts` - Account creation tests
5. `run-e2e-tests.sh` - Test runner script

## Next Steps

1. Create master account in Supabase
2. Configure authentication properly
3. Run full E2E test suite
4. Fix any failing tests
5. Deploy to staging environment
6. Perform user acceptance testing

## Conclusion

The application infrastructure is working correctly, but authentication needs to be properly configured before comprehensive testing can proceed. The security features are working as designed, which is a positive sign for production readiness.
