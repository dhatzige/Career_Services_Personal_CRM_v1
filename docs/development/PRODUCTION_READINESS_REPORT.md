- SSL/TLS configuration
- Backup strategy
- Monitoring setup
- Error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- Logging infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline

## 📊 Performance Considerations

1. **Database**
   - ❌ No connection pooling
   - ❌ Missing indexes for common queries
   - ❌ No query optimization
   - ❌ No caching layer

2. **Frontend**

## 🔧 Immediate Actions for Production

### Priority 1: Security (1-2 days)
1. Implement CSRF protection
2. Add input validation/sanitization
3. Move API keys to secure storage
4. Add password complexity rules
5. Implement session management

### Priority 2: Core Features (3-5 days)
1. Complete career tracking features (applications, interviews)
2. Implement document upload with security
3. Add follow-up reminders UI
4. Complete Calendly webhook integration

### Priority 3: Stability (2-3 days)
1. Add comprehensive error handling

## 💡 Recommendation

**Current State**: The app has a solid foundation but is **NOT ready for production** due to:
1. Missing critical career services features
2. Security vulnerabilities
3. Incomplete integrations

**Estimated Time to Production**: 8-10 days of focused development

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix security issues immediately
2. Implement missing career tracking features
3. Complete integrations (Calendly, AI)
4. Add proper error handling and logging
5. Create deployment documentation
