# How to Find Your Supabase Project URL

## Steps:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard (you're already there!)
2. Look for a section called **"Project URL"** or **"API URL"**
3. It will look like this: `https://nhzuliqmjszibcbftjtq.supabase.co`

## What I Need:

From the page you're on (API Keys settings), I need:

1. **Project URL**: `https://nhzuliqmjszibcbftjtq.supabase.co` (your project ID is `nhzuliqmjszibcbftjtq`)
2. **Anon/Public Key**: The long key that starts with `eyJ...` (safe for frontend)
3. **Service Role Key**: Another long key starting with `eyJ...` (backend only)

## Quick Check:

Based on your dashboard URL, your project URL should be:
```
https://nhzuliqmjszibcbftjtq.supabase.co
```

Can you confirm this is correct? Also, do you see two long keys (starting with 'eyJ') on that page?

## Security Note:
- The **anon key** is safe to share (used in frontend)
- The **service role key** should be kept secret (backend only)
- If you already shared keys earlier, make sure to regenerate them for security!
