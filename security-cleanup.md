# 🛡️ Security & Privacy Cleanup for GitHub Release

## ✅ Completed Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables Protection
- ✅ All `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Created `.env.example` and `.env.production.example` templates
- ✅ No real API keys or secrets committed to repository

### 2. Personal Information Sanitization
- ✅ Replaced personal emails in documentation (`dhatzige@act.edu` → `admin@yourdomain.com`)
- ✅ Removed production URLs from main documentation
- ✅ Sanitized Calendly integration references

### 3. Production URLs Sanitized
- ✅ Replaced specific Vercel and Fly.io URLs with examples
- ✅ Updated Supabase project references to use placeholders
- ✅ Made deployment guides generic

## 🔄 Files That Still Need Manual Review

### Test Files (62 files contain personal info)
These files contain test credentials and should be reviewed before public release:

1. **Playwright Tests** (`/playwright/tests/`)
   - Contains `dhatzige@act.edu` and passwords
   - Recommendation: Replace with `test@example.com` and generic passwords

2. **Test Archive** (`/test-archive/`)
   - Contains hardcoded Supabase URLs and keys
   - Recommendation: Delete or move to private folder

3. **Old Backup Files** (`/OLD_FILES_BACKUP/`)
   - Contains development credentials
   - Recommendation: Delete before public release

### Documentation Files
1. **README.md** - Contains production URLs
2. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Contains specific deployment URLs
3. **docs/** - Various docs contain production references

## 🎯 Recommended Actions Before GitHub Push

### IMMEDIATE (Critical)
1. **Delete or sanitize test files** with personal credentials
2. **Replace production URLs** in documentation with generic examples
3. **Remove OLD_FILES_BACKUP** and **test-archive** directories
4. **Update README.md** with generic deployment information

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Review all 62 files** containing personal information
2. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** with security guidelines
3. **Add security.txt** file for vulnerability reporting
4. **Add LICENSE** file

### OPTIONAL (Recommended)
1. **Add GitHub Actions** for automated security scanning
2. **Add dependabot** configuration for dependency updates
3. **Create templates** for issues and pull requests
4. **Add code of conduct**

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Secrets Management**: All sensitive data in environment variables
2. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation middleware
3. **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based auth with Supabase
4. **CORS**: Properly configured origin restrictions
5. **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting implemented
6. **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error responses
7. **HTTPS**: Enforced in production
8. **Security Headers**: Helmet.js implemented
