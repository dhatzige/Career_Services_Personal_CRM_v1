# Calendly Integration Fix Summary

## Issue
Calendly meetings weren't appearing in the system despite previously working (as evidenced by Eleftherios's consultation from Aug 12).

## Root Cause
The webhook subscription wasn't registered with Calendly's API. While the API credentials were present in the `.env` file, the webhook wasn't actively listening for Calendly events.

## Solution Applied
1. **API Credentials**: Confirmed present in `/backend/.env`:
   - `CALENDLY_API_KEY`: Line 42
   - `CALENDLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Line 41

2. **Webhook Registration**: Successfully registered webhook subscription:
   - Endpoint: `https://career-services-personal-crm.fly.dev/api/calendar/webhook/calendly`
   - Events: `invitee.created`, `invitee.canceled`, `invitee_no_show.created`
   - Webhook ID: `4d49f0fc-9fa9-4df5-9108-d23fd54e31c5`

## How It Works Now
When someone schedules via Calendly:
1. Calendly sends webhook to production backend
2. System creates/updates student record
3. Creates consultation record with Calendly details
4. Appears in upcoming meetings

## Files Involved
- `/backend/src/services/calendlyService.ts` - API service
- `/backend/src/controllers/calendarController.ts` - Webhook handler
- `/backend/src/routes/calendarWebhook.ts` - Webhook routes
- `/backend/.env` - API credentials (lines 41-42)

## Status
âœ… Fixed - Webhook registered and listening for Calendly events
