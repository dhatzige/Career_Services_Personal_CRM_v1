## 🎯 Current Sprint Status (August 8, 2025)
**Sprint 4, Week 1** - Filtering System & University Programs

### ✅ Just Completed (v0.11.4)

#### 1. Enhanced Filtering System
- **Removed "Recent Interactions" stat** - Was too complex and misleading
- **Added 2 new filter categories:**
  - Student Activity: Recently Viewed, Has Notes, No Notes, Resume on File, No Resume
  - Consultation Status: Had Consultations, Never Consulted, Upcoming, High No-Shows (3+)
- **Improved filter names for clarity:**
  - "Year of Study" → "Academic Year"
  - "Program Type" → "Degree Program"  
  - "Job Search Status" → "Career Status"
- **Recently Viewed Students** - Tracks last 10 in localStorage
- **Better UI** - Emojis, placeholders, "Filter students by:" label

#### 2. University Program Updates
- **Removed PhD** - University only has Bachelor's and Master's
- **Added specific Master's programs:**
  - MBA
  - Masters in Tourism Management
  - MS in Industrial Organizational Psychology
- **Smart selection** - Master's shows dropdown, Bachelor's shows text input

#### 3. Bug Fixes
- Fixed 500 error on student creation (missing quickNote field)
- Fixed filter logic for empty states
- Added job statuses: "Searching for Internship", "Currently Interning"

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE - CALENDLY INTEGRATION 🚨

**A Calendly meeting was scheduled for next week but it's NOT showing in the CRM!**

### Investigation Needed:
1. Check Calendly webhook configuration in Settings
2. Verify API endpoint `/api/integrations/calendly/webhook` is receiving events
3. Check backend logs for Calendly-related errors
4. Test manual sync from Integrations page
5. Verify CalendlyService initialization in server.ts

### Possible Causes:
- Webhook not configured or expired
- API key issues
- Event type mismatch
- Database write failures

**This is urgent** - Students are booking meetings that staff can't see!

## 💡 Quick Start for Next Session

npm run dev:frontend        # Port 5173

# Check Calendly integration
curl http://localhost:4001/api/integrations/calendly/status

```

## 📊 System Health
